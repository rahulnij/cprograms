To modify group credentials (ie, ID number + password pairs), edit serv/authfile.py.
To modify server application (like change the port number), edit serv/serv.py.
To start the server, cd to serv and run "./serv.py".
Navigate to http://localhost:8000 (where 8000=port in serv.py) and you'll see an empty table of groups. Click the "example" link at the bottom to see an example group form. Fill in the form with credentials from authfile.py and make up information for the Name, Value, and Status fields. Press submit and note the URL when redirected.

Client Application:
An example use of libcurl to automate the submission is given in client/test.c. Run "make" to build it. If the build fails, open test.c for further instructions on resolving missing dependencies.
